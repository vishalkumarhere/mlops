## Current Model (v2.0)
The current model uses two highly correlated features (featureA and featureB) achieving an R² score of 0.49. This represents an improvement over the previous single-feature model (v1.0, R²=0.26) while maintaining reasonable complexity. The added feature provides better capture of the y's (target) variance, though requires monitoring for potential overfitting with new data.

## Previous Model (v1.0)
Initial model using only featureA maintained simplicity but showed limited predictive power compared to the current version. Suitable for baseline predictions where interpretability is prioritized.
